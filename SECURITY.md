# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep QuickNotes.ink safe for everyone!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue or vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, email us directly at [przybylku@gmail.com](mailto:przybylku@gmail.com) with details. We'll get back to you as soon as possible (usually within a few days).

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit you in the release notes if you'd like!

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest major version. If you find a vulnerability in an older version, let us know and we'll do our best to help.
